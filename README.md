# Scrub Jay Peripherals: Business Planning Excel Simulation

## Project Summary
This project models a real-world business scenario for Scrub Jay Peripherals, a startup preparing to launch a new VR gaming handheld controller. The goal was to leverage Excel to create dynamic, data-driven sales, cost, and profit projections—essential for strategic planning and investor presentations.

## Workbook Structure

- **Sales Projections:**  
  Projects multi-year revenue growth using logical and arithmetic formulas, with dynamic updates via relative/mixed cell referencing and AutoFill for trend extension.

- **Cost Estimates:**  
  Summarizes category costs using functions like `AVERAGE`, `MAX`, `MIN`, and `VLOOKUP` for category-specific retrieval.

- **Profit Projections:**  
  Calculates expected profits by integrating date functions (`TODAY()`, `NETWORKDAYS()`), absolute referencing, and formula replication to model ongoing profitability.

## Core Excel Skills Applied

- **Formulas & Functions:**  
  Used arithmetic, statistical, lookup, and date functions for robust modeling.
- **Cell Referencing:**  
  Mastered relative, absolute, and mixed references for scalable calculations.
- **AutoFill & Data Incrementing:**  
  Efficiently extended projections using Excel’s AutoFill.
- **Data Structuring & Formatting:**  
  Maintained clean, consistent, and presentation-ready tables.
- **Logical Thinking:**  
  Built interconnected models that auto-update from single input changes.
- **Date Calculations:**  
  Applied date logic for scheduling and business timelines.

## Key Takeaways

- Hands-on experience structuring complex financial and operational models in Excel.
- Built projections that respond dynamically to input changes.
- Developed clear, business-ready spreadsheets for decision-making and presentations.
- Strengthened understanding of how formulas interact across multi-sheet workbooks.
