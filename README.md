Excel Project: Performing Calculations with Formulas and Functions
Project Description
This project simulates a real-world business scenario for Scrub Jay Peripherals, a startup planning to launch a new handheld controller for virtual reality gaming. As part of a business planning process, Excel is used to build out sales projections, cost estimates, and profit forecasting models to aid in decision-making and investor presentations.

The goal of this project was to apply core Excel functions and formula logic to create dynamic, data-driven models that automatically update based on given inputs, making it a great demonstration of foundational Excel skills in a business analytics context.

📄 Dataset Overview
The Excel workbook is divided into three key worksheets:

Sales Projections
Contains projected revenue growth percentages and multi-year sales estimates. It required logical and arithmetic operations using relative and mixed cell referencing, AutoFill, and formatting replication to build future projections.

Cost Estimates
Includes cost data for multiple product categories. Tasks focused on using statistical functions such as AVERAGE, MAX, and MIN to summarize cost data, and applying VLOOKUP to retrieve category-specific values from a defined range.

Profit Projections
Built to calculate expected profits based on projected revenue and cost data. This worksheet utilized date functions like TODAY() and NETWORKDAYS() to calculate working days, along with absolute referencing and multi-cell formula replication to model profitability over time.

🛠️ Excel Skills Practiced
🔢 Formulas & Functions: Applied arithmetic formulas and functions like AVERAGE, MAX, MIN, VLOOKUP, TODAY, and NETWORKDAYS.

🔁 Cell Referencing: Used relative, absolute, and mixed references effectively for flexible, scalable formulas.

📈 AutoFill & Incrementing Data: Leveraged Excel’s AutoFill to extend trends across years and percentages.

🗃️ Data Structuring & Formatting: Used proper formatting techniques to maintain consistency across tables.

🧠 Logical Thinking: Built dynamic models where one change in input data flows through and updates all related calculations automatically.

📆 Date Calculations: Utilized Excel's date functions for practical business timelines and scheduling insights.

✅ Key Takeaways
This project provided hands-on experience in:

Structuring financial and operational models in Excel

Making projections based on dynamic inputs

Understanding how formulas interact across multiple rows and columns

Creating professional, clean, and easy-to-read spreadsheets suitable for business presentations
